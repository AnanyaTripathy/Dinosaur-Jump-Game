# Dinosaur-Jump-Game
An often-overlooked Easter Egg in Google Chrome is the dinosaur game, which appears when you try to visit a website while disconnected from the Internet.
The Chrome dino game is a simple infinite runner, which sees you jump over cacti, and dodge underneath obstacles. Controls are basic. 
Press space to jump. 
The goal of the famous game is to survive for as long as humanly (or dinosaurly) possible â€” or at least until your Internet starts working again.

I tried to code the simple game using basic HTML.
So, what is your high score ?
